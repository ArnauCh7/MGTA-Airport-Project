Hi, in this file you'll find the instructions for the execution of the code for this project:

For executing the code the only file that you'll need to open is the one named "main",
in that file you can find a variable named "filename" in line 8 this is the only variable 
that you will need to change to get all the data from the different options of the project
wich are (Normal Regulation, Intermodality and Our Hypothesis of Intermodality)
the different values of filename for the different modes are the names of the ".xlsx"
(Excel) files on this folder:

Normal Regulation --> filename = "taulaDades.xlsx"
Intermodality --> filename = "DataTableWP5.xlsx"
Our Hypothesis --> filename = "DataTableWP5-2.xlsx"

When executed the code should return 9 plots and print in the console all the metrics
that we considered interesting for each of the solutions of the regulation (RBS, GDP, GHP).
Note that for both Intermodality and Our Hypothesis it also returns the values for RBS and 
GDP but on our report we only took the GHP values to evaluate those solutions.
